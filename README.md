<h1>TOADS-3D</h1>

<h3>About This Project</h3>
This project was initially developed as part of a Game Programming assignment. However, I am continuing to improve and expand the game until it reaches completion. Currently, the development focus has shifted to implementing a multiplayer feature, which will require a major overhaul of the existing codebase. Despite the extensive changes, the addition of multiplayer capabilities will significantly enhance the overall gameplay experience, making the effort worthwhile.

<h3>Meet Me</h3>

- Totti Adithana Sunarto (Lead Programmer & Technical Programmer & Level Designer)

<h3>Game Description</h3>
<p align="justify">TOADS-3D [Prototype] is a 3D Tank Battle Simulator game created within a one-month development period. As the Game Programmer, I was responsible for implementing all core systems, including the tank movement, various game mechanics, and the integration of NavMesh to enable AI-controlled enemies to navigate the battlefield effectively. In addition to handling the programming aspects, I also took charge of the level design, crafting engaging and challenging environments to test the player’s strategy and skill. This project served as a comprehensive demonstration of my ability to manage both the technical and creative elements of game development within a limited timeframe.

<h3>Target Gameplay</h3>
<p align="justify">TOADS-3D [Prototype] is a 3D Tank Battle Simulator game created within a one-month development period. Players engage in intense tank battles, maneuvering through diverse terrains while utilizing strategic gameplay mechanics. The focus is on realistic tank movement and dynamics, allowing players to experience the thrill of armored warfare. Combat involves taking advantage of various tank abilities, such as aiming and firing at enemy targets, while navigating the battlefield using tactical maneuvers. The game features AI-controlled enemies that utilize NavMesh for intelligent navigation, adding a layer of challenge as players must outsmart these opponents. The level design includes engaging and strategically crafted environments that encourage players to devise strategies to outmaneuver and outgun their adversaries, making for an exciting and immersive tank battle experience.</p>

# Game Mechanics I Created

<h3>Occlusion and LOD Optimization (Underway)</h3>
<p align="justify">The optimization process focuses on implementing occlusion culling and Level of Detail (LOD) techniques to enhance performance and visual fidelity. Occlusion culling helps reduce the rendering load by preventing the game engine from drawing objects that are not visible to the player. Meanwhile, LOD management dynamically adjusts the level of detail of objects based on their distance from the camera, ensuring that high-detail models are only used when necessary. This ongoing effort aims to provide a smoother gameplay experience while maintaining graphical quality.</p>

<h3>NfO (Netcode For GameObjects)(Not Implemented)</h3>
<p align="justify">The intention to integrate Netcode for GameObjects was to facilitate multiplayer capabilities, enabling players to engage in tank battles with friends or other players online. However, this feature has not yet been implemented in the current prototype. Future plans involve exploring this functionality to enhance the game's competitive aspects and allow for cooperative gameplay, ultimately providing a more engaging experience.</p>

<h3>URP Advanced PostProcessing</h3>
<p align="justify">This includes implementing effects such as ambient occlusion, bloom, and motion blur, which contribute to a more immersive atmosphere. Additionally, the integration of lens flare components enhances the realism of lighting effects during intense combat scenarios, while procedural skyboxes create dynamic, evolving skies that change throughout gameplay. By fine-tuning these effects, the game seeks to create a visually appealing experience that enhances player engagement and enjoyment.</p>

<h3>What I Learned</h3>
<p align="justify">Throughout the development of TOADS-3D [Prototype], I gained valuable insights into various aspects of game development, including optimization techniques such as occlusion culling and LOD management. I also learned about the challenges and considerations involved in implementing network functionality for multiplayer gameplay. Additionally, my experience with advanced post-processing in URP expanded my understanding of visual effects and how they impact player perception. Overall, this project has significantly enriched my skills in programming, level design, and game optimization.</p>
